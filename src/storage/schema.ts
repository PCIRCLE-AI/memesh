-- Proof that a capture hook actually RAN. Nothing else in this schema can

-- the first and stayed silent on the second.
--
-- Written by the three hooks that hold a read-write handle (Stop, PreCompact,
-- PostToolUse), each calling recordHookRun() at its own SUCCESSFUL exit —
-- after capture, not at open. Stamping at open certified the wrong thing: a
-- hook that opened the database and then died mid-capture looked alive for a
-- day. "Successful" is precise: a completed capture, or a well-formed
-- payload the hook correctly decided not to capture (dedup, low-signal
-- session). A malformed payload (schema-flip shapes) and a write that did
-- not land both leave no stamp — either would make the heartbeat mask the
-- exact dropout it exists to expose. The recall-side hooks open read-only
-- and deliberately do not appear here: their liveness answers a different
-- question, and giving them a write handle would put a lock acquisition on
-- the SessionStart hot path.

 * and never reinserted, because the in-memory row list predated it. The marker
 * then committed, so it never retried. Measured: the entity row survives, the
 * index has no trace of it, and the marker reads 1.
 *
 * `.immediate()` takes the write lock at BEGIN, so a concurrent writer either
 * finishes before the migration reads or waits until after it commits.
 *
 * **Failure backs off.** The old catch deliberately left the marker unset so
 * the next open would retry — but with no throttle, a persistently failing
 * rebuild re-paid a full corpus scan on every single process start, forever.
