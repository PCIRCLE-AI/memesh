// =============================================================================
// One-shot repairs for data that 4.8.2 and earlier wrote wrongly
// =============================================================================
//
// v4.8.2 fixed two memory-layer defects (#240, #241). Both fixes stop the
// wrong rows from being written; neither touches the rows already there. On
// the maintainer's own graph that was 706 duplicate observations across
// session summaries and four `-other` lesson entities holding 39 unrelated
// lessons — and 4.8.2 itself still left readable-only explicit lesson names
// behind, so a re-learn after upgrade split one lesson's history across a
// legacy entity and its new digest-named successor.
// A fix that only prevents new damage leaves `scripts/audit/memory-invariants.mjs`
// red on every existing install forever, and leaves recall matching the fused
// buckets (retrieved 61 times, matched 3) instead of the lessons in them. That
// same 61/3 also stayed on the bucket forever after a split, because the split
// moved observations and left the entity's recall_hits/recall_misses columns
// untouched — see `retireRecallHistory` for why that number belongs to no
// lesson once the bucket has been split apart.
//
// So the data is repaired here, once, at the first open through the core
// `openDatabase` after upgrade — CLI, MCP, HTTP, and the two hook paths that
// import dist/db.js (the hooks' own wrapper in scripts/hooks/_shared.js runs
// no migrations) — the same place and the same shape as every other backfill
// in db.ts: a `runOnceMigration` keyed in `memesh_metadata`, transactional,
// non-fatal, one line on stderr when it changed something.
//
// Four passes, each owning exactly one invariant from memory-invariants.mjs:
//
//   dedupeObservations            → no-entity-carries-the-same-observation-twice
//   retractZeroEditClaims         → stop-summary-does-not-assert-zero-edits-for-bash-sessions
//   splitFusedLessons             → explicit-lessons-not-fused-into-other-bucket
//   repairFusedLessonShellHistory → split-lesson-shell-carries-no-recall-history
//
// What each pass does NOT do, and why:
//   - The dedupe keeps the lowest id of each (entity, content) pair and leaves
//     the entity's vector alone: the set of sentences is unchanged, so the
//     embedding of "name + observations" is the same text minus repeats.
//   - The split moves observation ROWS rather than copying them, so ids and
//     created_at survive and nothing is re-authored. EVERY explicit lesson
//     leaves the bucket — keeping the first would leave one lesson whose
//     re-learned copy lands beside its history instead of on it, the exact
//     state the split exists to end. The emptied bucket is archived, not
//     deleted: the entity row and its relations stay (the work-layer graph
//     view filters archived ends out; the full view still names it). Its
//     `source:explicit` tag is dropped ONLY when it emptied — a bucket that
//     kept a stray row must stay visible to the invariant, not be hidden
//     from it by losing the tag.
//   - Vectors are left where they are. sqlite-vec is loaded AFTER the
//     backfills run, so this code cannot touch `entities_vec` and does not
//     pretend to; it records that a rebuild is owed (`pending_reindex`, the
//     flag `memesh doctor` reports and `memesh reindex` clears). Until then
//     the bucket's old vector still describes text it no longer holds.
//   - FTS is rebuilt whole (`rebuildFtsIndex`, the same call the segmentation
//     migration makes) rather than patched row by row. `entities_fts` is
//     contentless: a delete must repeat the exact text that was indexed, and a
//     row the hook wrote without indexing has none — deleting it corrupts the
//     index ("database disk image is malformed"). A rebuild has no such input.
//   - `severity:*` is copied to a split-out lesson only when the bucket has
//     exactly one such tag. With several, which lesson was `critical` is not
//     recorded anywhere, and guessing would write a fact nobody stated. The
//     same rule for `source:explicit`: it is carried only when the bucket has
//     no `source:auto-learned` tag beside it.

/**
 * Zero an emptied entity's `recall_hits` / `recall_misses` and, if either was
 * nonzero, keep the number under `metadata.retired_recall` rather than just
 * dropping it.
 *
 * Why zero rather than divide among the lessons the entity was split into,
 * or copy the full count onto each: a hit/miss is recorded against the
 * BUCKET id (the Stop hook's `[mem:<id>]` marker names what was injected),
 * never against one observation inside it, so there is no record of which
 * split-out lesson a given hit belonged to. Dividing invents a fraction
 * nothing earned; copying the total onto every successor claims each one
 * independently has the bucket's whole track record. Neither is a number
 * that happened.
 *
 * Zero is not "we don't know" either, so it is not simply the honest
 * default: this repair's own header names the reason the bucket's rate
 * cannot be trusted for ANY successor even in aggregate — "recall matching
 * the fused buckets ... instead of the lessons in them". A bucket that
 * fuses N unrelated lessons is broad enough to get injected often and, being
 * mostly irrelevant to any one need, cited rarely — a rate produced by
 * fusion, the exact defect being repaired here, not a measurement of what
 * the individual lessons are worth. Inheriting it in any proportion would
 * carry that artifact into entities the fusion never touched.
 *
 * That leaves an entity that no longer holds any lesson still holding a real
 * historical number. It is not deleted outright: `metadata.retired_recall`
 * keeps it for forensic reading, the same way `split_from` keeps where a
 * successor came from — only the live `recall_hits`/`recall_misses` columns,
 * which feed `impactScore` (scoring.ts) and the unfiltered
 * `SUM(recall_hits) FROM entities` in `scripts/audit/measure-signals.mjs`,
 * are cleared. Archived rows are excluded from the default FTS/vector
 * candidate set (`archiveEntity()` removes the FTS row; `search()`'s
 * `statusFilter` defaults to active-only), so a shell's stale rate is not
 * currently swaying live ranking — but it does inflate that audit sum
 * forever, and it is wrong on any code path that reads an entity by id with
 * `includeArchived: true`.
 *
 * No-ops (and touches nothing) when both counters are already 0 — the
 * common case: 45 of the 49 archived shells measured on a real graph on
 * 2026-09-02 had never earned a hit or a miss before being split.

 * #240 — an entity carries each observation once.
 *
 * The Stop hook re-appended the same summary on every Stop when a session's
 * edits went through Bash. Deletes every observation whose exact content
 * already appears on the same entity with a lower id.
 *
 * SCOPE, version 2: every entity except the lesson family
 * (`lesson_learned`, `lesson`, `mistake`), not `session-%`.
 *
 * Version 1 filtered on `e.name LIKE 'session-%'` — the name the one hook
 * fixed for #240 wrote. The PreCompact and PostToolUse-commit hooks kept
 * writing the same duplicates under `pre-compact-<sessionId>` and
 * `commit-<sha>`, and this repair could not touch a row of it: 2,202
 * duplicate rows on the maintainer's graph, unreachable by the pass whose
 * whole job was to remove them. The invariant this pass owns
 * (`no-entity-carries-the-same-observation-twice`) was re-keyed to the
 * question rather than the name; so is this.
 *
 * The version bump from 1 to 2 is what makes it run again. `runOnceMigration`
 * stores the version under `SESSION_DEDUPE_KEY`, and every graph that opened
 * under 4.8.2+ already has `1` there — widening the SQL alone would be a
 * repair that reads as applied and never fires. The key STRING is unchanged
 * on purpose: it is persisted state, and renaming it would restart the
 * bookkeeping rather than continue it.
 *
 * Re-running is safe: deleting rows that no longer exist is a no-op, so a
 * graph already cleaned by version 1 loses nothing.
 *
 * `lesson_learned`, `lesson` and `mistake` are the types excluded — the same
 * three types the rest of this repository already treats as one lesson
 * family (src/core/analytics.ts, src/core/work-topology.ts,
 * src/core/doctor.ts, scripts/hooks/_shared.js) — and the predicate matches
 * the invariant's exactly so the pass and the check it owns cannot drift.
 * Every reader that consumes observations as CONTENT selects `content` alone
 * (the one `created_at` select is `splitFusedLessons` below, which moves rows
 * and never displays it), so a repeated row is invisible on every OTHER type.
 * On the lesson family there are two readers that treat the list as ORDERED
 * BLOCKS instead: `groupLessons` below, cutting a lesson bucket at each
 * `Error: ` line, and the dashboard's `parseStructuredBlocks`
 * (dashboard/src/components/LessonCards.tsx), which does the same cut keyed
 * on content shape rather than type — so it reaches `lesson` and `mistake`
 * entities too, not only `lesson_learned`. Deleting a repeat there is not
 * removing a duplicate fact, it is merging two lessons — two blocks in one
 * bucket legitimately share a `Fix:` or `Root cause:` line, and the second
 * copy of that line belongs to the second lesson. `splitFusedLessons` runs
 * after this pass and parses exactly those rows.

/**
 * D11/D12 — an archived entity is in NEITHER search index.
 *
 * `archiveEntity` always dropped both index rows. `compressWeeklyNoise`, the
 * dreamer's compaction apply and `splitFusedLessons` archived with a bare
 * status UPDATE and dropped neither. Those three are fixed at the source, but
 * every graph written before the fix still holds the rows they left. Measured
 * on the maintainer's graph at 2136 entities (820 active, 1316 archived):
 *
 *   413 of 1013 vector rows belonged to archived entities — 41 real k-NN
 *       queries spent 290 of 820 top-20 slots (35.4%) on memories the user
 *       had put away, displacing active ones.
 *   213 archived entities were still in `entities_fts` — `MATCH 'ae83279'`
 *       returned the archived `commit-ae83279`.
 *
 * TWO `runOnceMigration` keys, not one, because the two halves have different
 * preconditions and one must not be able to mark the other done:
 *
 *   `archived_fts_rows`     always runnable — FTS5 is built into SQLite.
 *   `archived_vector_rows`  needs sqlite-vec loaded IN THIS PROCESS.
 *
 * On a platform sqlite-vec publishes no binary for, the vector half can never
 * run. Folded into one key it would either strand the FTS repair on those
 * machines forever, or stamp a marker over work that did not happen — and this
 * file exists precisely because "a fix that only prevents new damage" is not
 * enough. Split, each machine repairs what it can, and the vector half runs
 * the first time the file is opened somewhere that has the binary.
 *
 * The FTS half rebuilds the whole index rather than deleting the archived rows
 * one by one, for the reason the header gives: a contentless delete must repeat
 * the exact text that was indexed, and where an entity was re-remembered while
 * archived the index holds TWO documents at its rowid whose combined text
 * nothing can reconstruct. `rebuildFtsIndex` starts from `delete-all` and
 * re-inserts active rows only, so it needs no such input and clears both
 * defects at once. It is idempotent and may already have run this open.
 *
 * **Must be called AFTER the sqlite-vec load in `openDatabase`**, unlike the
 * three passes above, which run before it and therefore cannot touch
 * `entities_vec` at all.
 *
 * @returns `{ ftsRows, vectorRows }` — rows removed by each half, or -1 for a
 *          half that did not run.
