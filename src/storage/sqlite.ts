/**
 * The SQLite driver, and the two methods node:sqlite does not ship.
 *
 * memesh used to run on `better-sqlite3`, whose install script is
 * `prebuild-install || node-gyp rebuild`. That binds the compiled binary to a
 * Node ABI, so a Node upgrade breaks it and `--ignore-scripts` never builds it
 * at all — which is exactly how a `/plugin install` produced a memesh whose
 * hooks silently did nothing, because Claude Code installs plugins with
 * `--ignore-scripts`. `node:sqlite` is part of the runtime: no binary, no
 * install script, nothing to rebuild.
 *
 * The only two things better-sqlite3 had that node:sqlite does not are
 * `db.pragma()` and `db.transaction()`. They are re-added here as a subclass
 * rather than as free functions on purpose: every existing call site keeps its
 * shape, so the migration is a change of driver and not a rewrite of 17
 * transaction bodies whose rollback behaviour is load-bearing.

 * Load node:sqlite without printing Node 22's experimental warning.
 *
 * The warning is emitted once, when the module is first loaded, and memesh
 * supports Node >= 22.13 — so on the rest of the Node 22 LTS line every CLI
 * invocation, every hook and every MCP handshake would print a line users
 * cannot act on. Node 24 and 26 emit nothing.
 *
 * The patch is surgical and temporary: it drops only this one warning, passes
 * every other warning through untouched, and `process.emitWarning` is restored
 * before this function returns — including when the load throws, which is why
 * the restore is in a `finally`. Verified on 22.23.2 (warning suppressed, an
 * unrelated warning still emitted, hook stayed restored), 24.15.0 and 26.5.1.
 *
 * `createRequire` rather than `await import()`: a top-level await here would
 * make every importer of this module async for no gain, and `node:sqlite` is a
 * builtin so `require` resolves it in an ESM file without a file lookup.
