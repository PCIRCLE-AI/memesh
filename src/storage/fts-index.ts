// =============================================================================
// FTS5 index helpers — contentless-FTS5 delete + insert primitives
// =============================================================================
//
// SQLite's `content=''` FTS5 mode requires that deletes supply the
// previously-indexed column values (otherwise the row stays in the
// index). The pattern is:
//
//   INSERT INTO entities_fts(entities_fts, rowid, name, observations)
//   VALUES('delete', <rowid>, <previous-name>, <previous-obs-text>);
//   INSERT INTO entities_fts(rowid, name, observations) VALUES(?, ?, ?);
//
// This dance is identical at every call site. Centralizing it here:
//   - removes a documented drift hazard (4 inline copies in
//     knowledge-graph.ts + lifecycle.ts)
//   - gives a single place to bump if FTS schema changes
//   - keeps the helpers parameterless from `KnowledgeGraph`-state so
//     they can be called from non-class contexts (lifecycle.ts)

 * Scripts whose writing systems do not put spaces between words. FTS5's
 * `unicode61` tokenizer treats every character in these ranges as a letter, so
 * an unbroken run becomes ONE token: a memory holding 「資料庫遷移前一定要先備份」
 * was reachable only by searching that exact string, and 「資料庫」 matched
 * nothing. Measured on a mixed corpus, Chinese recall was 2/9.
 *
 * The list is derived from the writing system, not from which languages came
 * up first. Version 2 covered CJK ideographs, kana and hangul — which fixed
 * Chinese, Japanese and Korean and left every OTHER spaceless script with the
 * identical defect, undetected because no test used one. Measured on a fresh
 * database at version 2: Thai, Lao, half-width kana and CJK Extension B all
 * stored fine and were unfindable by any fragment of themselves.

 *   U+FF66-U+FF9D    half-width katakana
 *   U+20000-U+3FFFF  CJK Extension B and beyond (non-BMP)
 *
 * Written as escapes rather than literals: several of these boundaries are
 * unassigned or non-printing code points, and a character-class range whose
 * endpoint got mangled by an editor or a terminal fails silently — it just
 * stops segmenting part of a script.
 *
 * The ranges are the single source for two derived forms below — the regex
 * character class used for segmentation, and the SQL GLOB pattern
 * `src/core/doctor.ts` binds to find runs an older build left unsegmented.
 * Deriving both is the point: doctor's copy was originally a hand-written
 * CJK-only pair, and this list has since grown to ten ranges, so a hand-written
 * copy would have gone on reporting a healthy index over an unsegmented Thai
 * one.
