//
// `agent_message_deliveries` keys an inbox on (`project`, `recipient`), and
// both arrived as free text with no canonical form at all. On the maintainer's
// own graph that split one logical inbox across spellings:
//
//   recipient  root 25          vs  /root 20
//   project    memesh 38        vs  memesh-llm-memory 28
//              /Users/ktseng/Developer/Projects/memesh-llm-memory 1
//
// A recipient that fetches under one spelling never sees what was sent under
// the other, and `briefing`'s unread count is computed per spelling.
//
// What this module does, and — more importantly — what it deliberately does
// NOT do. Merging two identities that are genuinely different is worse than
// the split it would close: it delivers one agent's messages to another. So
// the only transformations here are ones that provably preserve identity:
//
//   1. Unicode NFC. Two byte-different strings that Unicode itself calls
//      canonically equivalent are one name; SQLite compares bytes and would
//      call them two. No such value exists in the measured graph — this is a
//      forward-looking safety property, not a fix for something observed.
//   2. Trim. Already the previous behaviour of `requireText`; kept.
//
// Everything else is a REFUSAL rather than a rewrite. In particular an
// absolute filesystem path is not a scope identifier and never can be:
// `getProjectName` (core/paths.ts) hashes a credential-free remote locator or
// native real path into `<label>~<32 hex>`, which cannot begin with a separator
// or a drive letter. So a value
// of that shape is provably not a project identity this product produced, and
// the same holds for the agent id on the other side of the same key. Refusing
// it names the field and what a valid value looks like; silently rewriting
// `/root` to `root` would also silently fuse `/tmp/root` with `/var/root`.
//
// Why not lowercase, strip prefixes, or collapse separators: none of those is
// provably identity-preserving. `claude-code:session_X` vs `session_X` looks
// like a namespace prefix, but `claude-code:` appears nowhere in this
// repository's source, artifacts, or git history (`git log -S 'claude-code:'
// --all` is empty), so there is no convention to normalise against, and
// stripping it would merge a legitimate `claude-code:reviewer` with a
// different agent called `reviewer`.
