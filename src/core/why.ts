// =============================================================================
// Why — file-level attribution: which commits memesh remembers touching a
// file, which sessions those commits came from, and which memories are
// associated with the file.
//
// Two halves with different trust models, kept as separate functions:
//
//   resolveFileCommits() shells out to LOCAL git (log / blame). Only the CLI
//   calls it, with the user's own cwd. The HTTP route never runs git — it
//   takes commit hashes the caller resolved themselves, so the server's
//   attack surface stays pure-DB.
//
//   explainCommits() is the DB half, shared by CLI and HTTP.
//
// Honesty contract (the reason this module exists at all): every gap in the
// chain is reported as a TYPED abstention, never papered over. A commit that
// predates memesh capture is `no_commit_entity`; a commit entity written
// before commits recorded their session is `no_session_link`. The
// `file_memories` block is labelled `basis: 'file-tag'` because it is
// associated by basename tag, NOT derived from the commits — the two must
// never be presented as the same kind of evidence.
