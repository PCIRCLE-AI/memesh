// =============================================================================
// transcript-extractor — mine conversational memory from session transcripts
// =============================================================================
//
// This is the EXTRACTION half (Task #18, B2). B1 (transcript-source.ts) is the
// read-only discovery half — it finds the JSONL files. This module reads a
// session's conversation, asks an LLM for the durable, high-value memories
// hidden in the prose, and STAGES them as `dream_proposals` for human review.
// It never touches the knowledge graph directly — a proposal only becomes an
// entity when a human runs `memesh dream accept`.
//
// THE HOLE THIS FILLS
// ───────────────────
// The existing transcript path (extractor.ts `parseTranscript`, the
// session-summary hook) mines only MECHANICAL signals: files edited, bash
// commands, errors. The actually-valuable memory — the decision made, the
// lesson learned, the WHY — lives in the conversational text (user messages +
// assistant reasoning) and was mined by NOTHING. This module mines that.
//
// SAME-SESSION CONTRADICTION GUARD (the key correctness item)
// ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// A transcript contains wrong turns and later-corrected claims. Something
// stated then reversed later in the SAME session must not be recorded as a
// live fact. The defense is a time-ordered prompt (ORDERING_INSTRUCTION): the
// conversation is presented in chronological order and the model is told that
// later statements override earlier ones. This is a prompt-level control — with
// an LLM it is where the correctness lives. The tests pin that the instruction
// is present and the turns are chronological; they cannot (and do not claim to)
// prove model compliance against a stubbed LLM.
//
// The guard is SESSION-level, not per-chunk. The budget (CHUNK_CHAR_BUDGET) is
// sized so a typical session is a single chunk, so the model sees the whole
// conversation and every reversal in it. Only a genuinely huge session chunks;
// when it does, each later chunk's prompt carries a rolling summary of prior
// chunks' EXTRACTED decisions (see buildExtractionPrompt's priorDecisions), so
// a decision made in chunk 1 and reversed in chunk 3 can still be overridden.
// The honest limit: this only carries decisions the model actually extracted in
// the earlier chunk — a reversal of something it never surfaced as a standalone
// memory is not caught. That residual is why the budget is large: keeping
// typical sessions to one chunk is the real protection; the rolling summary is
// the fallback for the rare multi-chunk case.
//
// KNOWN RESIDUALS (surfaced, never silent)
// ────────────────────────────────────────
//  - Size cap: a session longer than MAX_CHUNKS_PER_SESSION × CHUNK_CHAR_BUDGET
//    has its TAIL turns dropped before extraction. The tail is usually the
//    newest content and the likeliest place a reversal lives, so this is not
//    silent: `chunkTurns` counts the dropped turns, `extractMemoriesFromTranscript`
//    returns them as `truncatedTurns`, and `dream run --from-transcripts` prints
//    "M turns beyond the size cap not analysed" per session. Never a silent 0.
//  - Secret scrubbing is PREFIX-based: it redacts credentials with a known
//    shape (PEM blocks incl. truncated ones, provider key prefixes, DB URLs,
//    JWTs). A bare high-entropy hex/base64 blob with NO recognisable prefix is
//    NOT caught — accepted for a prefix scanner. The drop gate (containsSecret)
//    shares the same patterns, so this is a detection limit, not a scrub bug.
//
// TYPES IT EMITS vs the compaction dreamer
// ────────────────────────────────────────
// The extractor emits `decision` / `lesson_learned` / `fact`. Those first two
// are in the dreamer's PROTECTED_TYPES, so an accepted transcript memory can
// never later be eaten by the weekly compaction pass. That is deliberate, not
// accidental — this content is the high-value kind compaction exists to protect.

// Vector dedup against ALREADY-ACCEPTED / manually-remembered entities (B3).

// after a `dream accept` re-proposes the same memory (the disclosed gap). B3
// closes it: before staging, embed the candidate and query the SAME vector index
// recall uses (entities_vec via embedder.vectorSearch), and if the candidate is
// close enough to an existing entity, skip it (and REPORT the skip — a silent
// drop is the absence-is-not-evidence trap). Skip, not update/link: skip is the
// safe, simple B3 choice; staging it as an update/link to the matched entity is
// future work (B4).
//
// This also catches genuine overlap with a manually-remembered entity, not only
// re-runs — anything embedded in this project's slice of entities_vec.
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

/**
 * Cut-off in the units `entities_vec` returns — L2 over unit vectors, range
 * 0…2 (see embedder.ts MAX_VECTOR_DISTANCE for why L2). A candidate whose
 * nearest same-project entity is within this distance is treated as a
 * near-duplicate and NOT staged.
 *
 * This is a DIFFERENT question from recall's MAX_VECTOR_DISTANCE (1.00 = "is
 * this related enough to surface"). Dedup asks "is this the SAME memory", which
 * is a much tighter bar, so it gets its own, tighter number.
 *
 * MEASURED ON A REAL KNOWLEDGE GRAPH, which is what changed this number.
 *
 * The first derivation used a synthetic fixture of 10 hand-written duplicate
 * pairs and 10 hand-written distinct pairs. It put the false-positive cliff at
 * 0.668 and chose 0.55 as a conservative 0.118 below it. The fixture was wrong
 * about the cliff, and the comment said so at the time — "surface to a human
 * before trusting this".
 *
 * Re-measured 2026-08-09 against a live graph (214 active entities, 47 of them
 * transcript-mined memories a human had reviewed and ACCEPTED), embedding every
 * entity through the same ollama nomic-embed-text call the runtime makes, on the
 * same `${name} ${obs.join(' ')}` text `findDuplicateEntity` uses:
 *
 *   accepted transcript memory -> nearest existing entity
 *     min 0.446   p5 0.506   p25 0.621   p50 0.697   max 0.838
 *
 * At 0.55 that drops 6 of 47 — 13% of the memories a human chose to keep,
 * silently. And the closest pair it drops is not a duplicate at all:
 *
 *   0.446  "data_seeding_integrity"  ~  "graph_relation_integrity"   DISTINCT
 *   0.506  "audit-baseline-metadata" ~  "audit_baseline_structure"   arguable
 *   0.527  "auto-update-cache-population" ~ "auto-populate-update-cache"  DUPLICATE
 *
 * So the real false-positive floor is 0.446, not 0.668 — the synthetic fixture
 * overstated it by 0.22, and 0.55 sat ABOVE the real floor rather than below it.
 * The two classes overlap on real data in roughly 0.44…0.53, exactly as the
 * fixture warned they might; a single distance cannot separate them.
 *
 * 0.44 keeps the choice already made — a false positive is invisible data loss
 * and strictly worse than re-proposing a duplicate, which a human rejects in one
 * keystroke — and anchors it to the measured floor instead of a guessed one. It
 * still catches the case this exists for: re-running the SAME session produces
 * identical candidate text at distance ~0.
 *
 * Two things to know before re-deriving:
 *   - Measure in the `name + observations` space. A graph whose vectors were
 *     last written by an older `reindex` holds observations-only vectors (KT's
 *     did, 25 of 25 sampled), and distances measured there describe a space the
 *     dedup path does not use. Run `memesh reindex` first.
 *   - Measure against ACCEPTED memories, not a global nearest-neighbour sweep.
 *     The global figure is dominated by formulaic `commit-*` and `session-*`
 *     families that cluster at 0.135 and that no transcript candidate resembles
 *     (nothing closer than 0.78). It says 44% where the real answer is 13%.
