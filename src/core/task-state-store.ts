// The pure half (field rules, name convention, rendering) lives in
// `task-state.ts`, which is a runtime leaf so the hooks can copy it. This file
// is the half that needs a database.
//
// It deliberately writes THROUGH `remember()` rather than touching the tables
// itself. That is not indirection for its own sake: `remember()` is where
// FTS indexing, project tagging and signal scoring happen, and a second write
// path that skipped them is exactly how this
// repository shipped the P0 where session memories were unrecallable.
