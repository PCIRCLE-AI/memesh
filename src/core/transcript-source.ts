// Mining Claude Code session transcripts as a dreamer input source.
//
// This module is the READ-ONLY discovery half (B1): it locates the JSONL
// transcripts Claude Code writes for a project and reports what is available
// to mine. It never calls an LLM, never writes to the graph, and never
// mutates a transcript — the extraction / dedup / staging halves (B2+) build
// on top of what this returns.
//
// Why a transcript source at all: the capture hook (session-summary) already
// parses these files, but only at session end and only if the hook fired
// (native binding built, hooks wired, session ended naturally, agentic-loop
// guard did not filter it — the `hook_runs` heartbeat and doctor's
// hook-activity check exist because that chain breaks often). The files
// themselves are on disk regardless. A batch that reads them directly is
// dropout-proof.

 * Claude Code names each project's transcript directory by taking the

 * own transcripts. It is a best-effort convention — if Claude Code changes
 * it, `scanTranscripts` degrades to "no sessions found", never throws.
 *
 * The scheme is LOSSY: every non-alphanumeric char collapses to '-', so
 * `/p/my-project` and `/p/my_project` map to the SAME slug directory. That
 * would let a "current project only" scan pull in a sibling project's
 * sessions and stamp them with the current project's tag. `recordedCwd` +
 * the per-session check in `scanTranscripts` closes that hole: Claude Code
 * writes the real absolute `cwd` on each conversation entry, so a session
