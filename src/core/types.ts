// Promoted from inline string-literal unions to named exports so all

// these TS-only types do not affect Zod validation.

/**
 * Relation types the code BRANCHES ON, and what each one does.
 *
 * A relation type is otherwise a free string: `createRelation()` accepts
 * anything and most types are inert labels. These two are not. They change what
 * MeMesh does, and one of them destroys something:
 *
 *   - `supersedes` archives the target entity, immediately, on write.
 *   - `contradicts` makes both entities surface as a conflict on every recall.
 *
 * Neither was named anywhere the caller could see. The MCP `remember` schema —
 * the ONLY description a model reads at run time — offered `"implements"` and
 * `"related-to"` as its examples, and both of those are inert. So the two types
 * with consequences were undiscoverable, while the two advertised ones did
 * nothing: `findConflicts()` ran on every single recall and could only ever
 * return `[]`, which every transport renders as "no conflicts" — a checked-and-
 * clean answer to a question nothing could ever answer. And `supersedes`, which
 * archives an entity, was reachable only by guessing the word.
 *
 * This map is the single source of truth. `tests/relation-types-documented.test.ts`
 * fails if the code branches on a relation type that is not listed here, and if
 * a type listed here is missing from the schema description the model reads.
 * Add a behavioural relation type without documenting it and the suite goes red.
