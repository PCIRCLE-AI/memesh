// =============================================================================
// briefing — the assembled work topology, for agents that do not run the hooks
// =============================================================================
//
// Claude Code gets the topology pushed at session start by
// `scripts/hooks/session-start.js`. Every other MCP client — Gemini, Codex,
// anything that speaks the protocol — runs no hooks, so until this existed
// they could reach the PARTS (recall, task_state) but never the assembled
// block. "Cross-vendor gets the assembled topology, not the parts" is A1c's
// acceptance criterion, verbatim.
//
// This deliberately does NOT share selection SQL with the hook. That is the
// A1a design decision, restated in work-topology.ts's header: each consumer
// owns its own database access with its own compat rules; what must exist
// exactly once — classification, phrasing, the assembly order, the budget,
// the fence — is imported from the single owners below.
//
// The selection is a LEAN read on purpose. The first version went through
// `kg.search`/`kg.listRecent`, which hydrate observations, tags and relations
// for every candidate (up to 2×400 rows to render ~35 lines) and bump
// `access_count` on all of them — recall's machinery, sized for limit≈20 and
// for callers that asked. A briefing is not an ask for 800 memories: it reads
// scalar columns for the window, ranks, gates, and fetches ONE snippet per
// survivor — the same shape the hook uses. It also tracks no access: the
// hook's injection never has, and a ranking signal that means "was shown
// unasked" would inflate frequency for whatever happened to be in the window.
