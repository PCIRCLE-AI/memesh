 *      identity, and `tim` vs `TIM` collapse to whatever the remote says.
 *   2. native real path of the git repo root — for a real repo with no remote.
 *      Still fixes the subdirectory split.
 *   3. native real path of the cwd — for non-git directories

 *      one project and leaked memories across them. The hash pins identity to

 *      for the same directory. (Existing non-git projects change identity
 *      once — `memesh kg rename-project --from <old> --to <new> --apply`
 *      merges the tags.)

 * A `config.project` override would sit above all three, but adding a config
 * field with no setter is itself the "fake working" pattern this audit is
 * removing; it should land WITH its setter, not before.
