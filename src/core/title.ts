// A LEAF on purpose: no imports, so scripts/generate-hook-core.mjs can copy it
// into scripts/hooks/_generated/ and every writer of a title — core remember
// (schemas.ts), the backfill (db.ts), and the capture hooks (_shared.js) —
// executes the SAME cap and truncation rule. These used to be three
// hand-mirrored copies ("mirrors TITLE_MAX_LENGTH in scripts/hooks/_shared.js"
// said the third one), so a cap change was a three-place edit that review had
// to catch.

/** Title cap, shared by every writer. A title should read as a short
 *  scannable label — distinctly shorter than MemoryRow's 160-char fallback
 *  preview, not a second paragraph. schemas.ts REJECTS above this length
 *  (API callers get an error they can react to); generators TRUNCATE to it
 *  (a heuristic writer has nobody to bounce the input back to). */
