/**
 * Where the work stands RIGHT NOW, derived from local git every time it is
 * asked. Never stored.
 *
 * Why this module exists. `task_state` records what the user said — a goal, a
 * next step — and the session-start block presented it as the project's
 * current status. Those are different things, and the difference is not
 * cosmetic: a memory is true forever once written (v4.6.0 really was released),
 * while status changes without anyone saying so. On 2026-08-24 the injected
 * block opened with "Just finished: v4.6.0" while 38 PRs had merged since and
 * npm was serving 4.7.3. Nothing was corrupted. The world had simply moved and
 * nothing had told the store.
 *
 * So status is derived here instead. Every field below is read from git at the
 * moment of the call, which makes it authoritative and makes staleness
 * impossible by construction rather than by discipline.
 *
 * LOCAL GIT ONLY — no network, no `gh`. Open-PR state would need auth, would
 * add latency to a hook with a budget measured in seconds, and would fail
 * offline. Local git answers "where am I" completely enough, in milliseconds.
 *
 * BEST-EFFORT, like every other read on the session-start path. A directory
 * that is not a repository, a machine without git, a timeout: all return null
 * and the block simply does not appear. This is the one design principle
 * status shares with memory — never break the session over context that is
 * nice to have.

/**
 * A LEAF module by requirement, not by preference.
 *
 * `scripts/generate-hook-core.mjs` mirrors compiled core modules into
 * `scripts/hooks/_generated/` so the hooks run the identical code, and it
 * flattens the paths as it copies — a mirrored module can only import other
 * mirrored ones. `why.ts` has the same five-second git wrapper and was the
 * obvious place to borrow from, but borrowing would have made this module
 * un-mirrorable and left the hook and the CLI deriving status differently,
 * which is the exact divergence `briefing.test.ts`'s parity case exists to
 * forbid. Eight lines duplicated is the cheaper half of that trade.
