    readonly description: "Use this to contact or discover another local agent on the same MeMesh instance. discover is a bounded, project-scoped live-directory read of active leases and returns only the router result; it performs no send, fetch, ACK, replay, or receipt work. send durably stores one untrusted JSON-encoded payload of at most 65536 UTF-8 bytes (64 KiB) idempotently. Native delivery has a separate 16384-byte (16 KiB) cap for the complete envelope, including routing metadata and payload. For target_kind=session, success requires the exact active native host to accept that full envelope. An oversized envelope returns native_message_too_large; other unavailable or rejected sessions return recipient_unavailable while preserving scoped recovery data. Principal targets retain durable store-and-forward behavior even when native delivery is unavailable. poll/fetch remain compatibility and recovery reads; intake, ack, disposition, and activation are separate explicit facts.
