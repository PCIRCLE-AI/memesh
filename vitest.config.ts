    //
    // FIRST, `@vitest/coverage-v8` was never installed, so `vitest --coverage`
    // answered `MISSING DEPENDENCY` and nobody could run it. The block was
    // labelled "(if needed)" and had never been needed, which is how a
    // 2,199-line module reached one assertion without anyone being able to see
    // it.
    //
    // SECOND, and worse once it did run: with no `coverage.include`, v8 reports
    // only files a test IMPORTED. A module no test touches is not 0% — it is
    // absent, and the summary then read **72.05%** while seven of the
    // fifty-three files under `src/` were missing from the report entirely,
    // among them `cli/view-live.ts` (2,199 lines) and `mcp/launcher.ts`, the
    // entry point every MCP client executes. With the globs below the same suite
    // measures **48.86%**. A coverage report that cannot show you a zero is a
    // gate that cannot fail, which is the defect this repository keeps finding
    // in other shapes.
    //
    // `all: true` is NOT the fix here and is not a valid option in Vitest 4 —
    // `include` is what widens the denominator. Verified by running one test
    // file: the denominator stays at 8,593 statements either way.

      // a coverage run that nothing runs and nothing fails is not a gate.
