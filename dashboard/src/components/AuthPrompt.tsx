/**
 * Token entry surface shown when /v1/* returns 401.
 *
 * The server protects /v1/* with bearer auth whenever bound to a
 * non-loopback host. Browsers cannot attach an Authorization header on
 * the top-level navigation that loaded /dashboard, so the SPA must
 * collect the token AFTER load and inject it on every fetch call.
 *
 * The token is the same string the operator set via MEMESH_REMOTE_TOKEN
 * (or the file at <memeshDir>/remote-token). Stored in localStorage so
 * it survives page reload on the same origin. An empty value is refused
 * here and stores nothing; the stored token is replaced when the operator
 * rotates it (the next 401 reopens this prompt) and the new one is pasted.
 *
 * Translation lookups here are bare, with no `|| 'English literal'` fallback
 * after them, deliberately. Such a fallback reads as a safety net and is not
 * one: the lookup returns the key string itself on a miss, which is truthy, so
 * the right-hand branch can never execute. When these keys were genuinely
 * absent this file rendered `auth.title` at an operator and the fallback did
 * nothing to stop it. English is already the fallback inside the lookup
 * (locale -> en -> key), and `tests/dashboard-i18n.test.ts` fails the build if
 * a key used here is missing from the English catalogue. A second, unsynced
 * copy of the English string in JSX buys drift risk and no protection.
 *
 * That test scans source text rather than parsing it, so writing an example
 * lookup call in a comment makes it demand a key of that name. Describe, don't
 * demonstrate — hence the prose above.
