/**
 * Categorical entity-type colours — the species palette. These map to NO
 * design token, so they are literals on purpose and are the sanctioned
 * exception to the token-literal gate. See DESIGN.md "Species palette".
 *
 * Every value is the output of ONE formula, not a hand-picked hue:
 *
 *     oklch(0.78 0.12 H)  →  sRGB hex
 *
 * Equal lightness and chroma across species means no type shouts over
 * another — the luminance channel is reserved for vitality (recency), per
 * DESIGN.md "Hue encodes species; luminance encodes vitality". The H per
 * type is recorded beside each entry; anchored hues (lesson 85, concept
 * 200, pattern 230) come from DESIGN.md, the rest are spaced ≥25° apart
 * with the life band (~135°) left to `--life` itself. The values are
 * written down (rather than computed at runtime) because
 * `tests/dashboard-i18n.test.ts` parses this block as the type vocabulary.
 *
 * The two types that coincide with a token are NOT here: `decision` =
 * `--life` (decisions are this brain's main produce) and `session-insight`
 * = `--text-2` (weak signal stays grey). `entity-display.ts` resolves those
 * from the tokens at runtime, so a palette change reaches them.
