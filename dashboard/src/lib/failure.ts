 *
 *   - `unreachable` — the request itself failed. The server is down, the
 *     port is wrong, the network dropped. Next step: check `memesh serve`.
 *   - `unreadable` — the request SUCCEEDED and the payload failed a shape
 *     guard. The server is fine; this bundle cannot read what it said —
 *     stale cached bundle or version skew. Next step: reload, then
 *     `memesh doctor`.
 *   - `ratelimited` — the server answered 429: it is fine and the bundle is
 *     fine, the client is simply asking too often. Next step: wait, then retry.
 *     Distinct because "reload / run doctor" is the wrong instruction — there is
 *     nothing to fix, only to slow down. (Only an exposed/--allow-remote server
 *     rate-limits; loopback is skipped.)
 *
 * Collapsing these into one "could not load" message sends half the users
 * chasing a server that is running fine.

 * server that is demonstrably running, and "go check `memesh serve`" would send
 * the user to a process that is fine. The first version of this labelled every

 *   - unreachable → "Check that `memesh serve` is still running, then reload."
 *     There is nothing to do in the browser first. Terminal, correctly.
 *   - unreadable  → "Reload the page. If this keeps happening, run `memesh
 *     doctor`." The fix is a reload; the command is an escalation. Labelling

/**
 * The user-facing sentence for a failed ACTION (save, seed, accept, run…), as
 * opposed to a failed data load. Loads route through failureMessage() because
 * "reload" is a sane next step there; for an action the errors split five ways:
 *
 *   - NetworkError      → the browser's "Failed to fetch" / "NetworkError when
 *                         attempting…" prose, which names neither the process
 *                         nor the fix. Replaced with the unreachable sentence.
 *   - AuthRequiredError → api() already announced the 401 and the app is
 *                         swapping in the auth prompt; the inline text only
 *                         flashes, so name the state rather than the exception.
 *   - HttpError         → the server answered non-2xx with a body api() could
 *                         not read as an envelope. Status + "try again /
 *                         memesh doctor" is everything that is known.
 *   - UnreadableResponseError → a 2xx whose body was not a readable reply
 *                         (api() throws this instead of the JSON parser's
 *                         own prose): the unreadable sentence, as for a load.
 *   - other Error       → api()'s envelope path: already the httpError.<code>
 *                         translation for a KNOWN code, the server's own prose
 *                         otherwise. Both are sentences meant for humans.
