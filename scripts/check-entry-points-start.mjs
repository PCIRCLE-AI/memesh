// Entry-point execution gate
// ===========================
//
// Every other gate in this repo asks "does the file exist", "does it parse",
// "is it in the tarball". None of them ever run the thing. That is how
// `.mcp.json` shipped naming a deleted server file — every MCP tool failed
// with `-32000 failed to reconnect`, and no gate said a word (see the
// comment on `mcpEntry()` in scripts/lib/executable-targets.mjs) — and it is
// how a `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` placeholder that cannot resolve outside a
// plugin loader has shipped in `.mcp.json` since 2026-05-13 without any
// check noticing.
//
// This gate spawns every declared bin (`package.json` `bin`) and every
// declared hook (`hooks/hooks.json`) once, with `process.execPath` — never a
// shell, never PATH — and checks that it starts. "Starts" means something
// different for each kind of entry point; see ASSERTIONS below for the
// per-binary reasoning.
//
// It runs with MEMESH_DIR/MEMESH_DB_PATH pointed at a throwaway directory it
// creates and removes. Nothing it spawns is allowed to touch a real
// ~/.memesh, and nothing it spawns is allowed to make a network call:
// MEMESH_AUTO_UPDATE=0 and MEMESH_AUTO_DETECT_LLM=0 keep it hermetic and
// keep a developer's real OPENAI_API_KEY/ANTHROPIC_API_KEY out of a
// subprocess this gate spawns.

/**
 * Which platforms cannot prove a given entry point starts, and why.
 *
 * Exported (not inlined) so a test can pin it without a Windows machine:
 * `tests/entry-points-start.test.ts` calls this with `'win32'`/`'darwin'`
 * directly rather than relying on CI to happen to run on the right OS the
 * day the pin needs checking.
 *
 * Only one entry exists today. `memesh-router` (src/host-runtime/router.ts)
 * calls `assertSecureLocalHostRuntimeSupported()` at MODULE SCOPE — line 16,
 * before any function boundary — and that call throws
 * `SECURE_LOCAL_HOST_RUNTIME_UNSUPPORTED` on win32 with no surrounding
 * try/catch anywhere between it and the module's top level. Windows support
 * for the secure local host runtime is an explicit, documented design
 * decision (config.ts:6-13), not a bug this gate should be reporting as one
 * — but the resulting failure is also not a clean "starts and reports
 * failure" the gate can assert on with confidence without a Windows machine
 * to verify the exact shape against. Skipping it, loudly, is more honest
 * than guessing at an assertion this repo cannot verify in this session.
 *
 * `memesh-host-claude`/`memesh-host-codex`/`memesh-host-acp` are NOT here:
 * all three read `MEMESH_HOST_CONFIG`/`--config` and throw "A host config
 * file is required…" BEFORE any Windows-specific code path is reached
 * (config.ts `readHostConfig` checks `configuredPath` before calling
 * `readHostConfigFile`, which is the only place `assertSecureLocalHostRuntimeSupported`
 * runs for those three). Their missing-config failure mode is identical on
 * every platform, so it is asserted on every platform — see ASSERTIONS
 * below, where two of the three currently fail that assertion for an
 * unrelated reason (a missing try/catch, not a Windows gap).
 *
 * @param {NodeJS.Platform} platform
 * @returns {{relativePath: string, reason: string}[]}

/**
 * `.mcp.json`/`hooks/hooks.json` both name their entry point as
 * `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/...`. That placeholder is legitimate in exactly one
 * of the two manifests.
 *
 * `hooks/hooks.json` is reachable ONLY through Claude Code's plugin loader —
 * there is no "project-scoped hooks" auto-discovery the way there is for MCP
 * servers, so every hook command this repo ships is invoked with
 * CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT defined by the harness that read the plugin manifest in
 * the first place. `scripts/hooks/_shared.js`'s `resolvePluginRoot()` even
 * recomputes the same root independently from `import.meta.url`, which is
 * belt-and-braces for a hook script that already knows it will always be
 * plugin-loaded — not evidence that the manifest string itself needs to
 * resolve some other way.
 *
 * `.mcp.json` is different: Claude Code ALSO auto-discovers a project-root
 * `.mcp.json` as a project-scoped MCP server declaration, independent of
 * whether MeMesh is installed as a plugin at all. In that load path nothing
 * defines CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT, so `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/dist/mcp/server.js`
 * is not a path — it is the literal seven characters `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`
 * followed by a filename Claude Code will never resolve. This is the
 * `-32000 failed to reconnect` defect referenced at the top of this file.
 *
 * So each manifest gets checked against the substitution environment its
 * OWN real load path actually provides — not the pre-stripped path
 * `hookCommands()`/`mcpEntry()` in executable-targets.mjs return, which
 * unconditionally strips the `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/` prefix for BOTH
 * manifests (that helper answers "what file, once resolved" — a different
 * question from "does this manifest's own load path resolve it"). Checking
 * the stripped path here would make this whole rule vacuous: it would find
 * nothing, in every manifest, forever.
