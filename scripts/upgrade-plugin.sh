# upgrade-plugin.sh — one-liner upgrade for the Claude Code plugin install.
#
# Use:
#   bash scripts/upgrade-plugin.sh
#
# What it does:
#   1. Fast-forwards the marketplace cache under
#      ${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-~/.claude}/plugins/marketplaces/pcircle-memesh
#      against origin.
#   2. Reads the new version from .claude-plugin/marketplace.json at the exact
#      marketplace commit that will be installed.
#   3. Stages a new install cache under the same Claude config root at
#      plugins/cache/pcircle-memesh/memesh/<new-version>/,
#      from `git archive` of the exact recorded commit (never the marketplace
#      checkout's working tree, which can hold uncommitted or tampered files).
#   4. Installs runtime deps inside that cache (npm install --omit=dev).
#   5. Patches plugins/installed_plugins.json under that config root to point at the
#      new version + path, rolling the cache swap back if the write fails,
#      the registry changed underneath it, or a signal interrupts the swap.
#   A same-version refresh (marketplace moved, version did not) is staged next
#   to the live cache and swapped in only after npm install succeeded.
#   The whole run holds a lock directory so two invocations cannot race.
#
# Why this exists:
#   Claude Code's plugin marketplace pins versions at install time and
#   does not auto-update. Without this script, every user on an old
#   version has to uninstall + reinstall from the /plugin UI to pick
#   up a new release — even for security advisories.

set -uo pipefail

# D9: removes every OTHER stale version directory under $root, not just the
# one an upgrade just swapped out. Before the atomic-swap rename elsewhere in
# this script, an interrupted or pre-this-mechanism upgrade could leave a
# version directory behind with nothing left to remove it later — measured
# on a real machine: 9 old version directories, 1.2 GB, accumulated with no
# bound. Only entries whose full name is exactly `<major>.<minor>.<patch>`
# are touched, so a `.staging-*`/`.previous-*` marker from a genuinely
# concurrent run (should be impossible under $LOCK_DIR, but this check does
# not rely on that) or anything else unexpected under $root is left alone.
# $keep_version is always excluded; an optional $also_keep protects a second
# name — the registry's OWN recorded install path (however it is spelled),
# so the noncanonical-path repair in section 2 below can keep leaving that
# one directory alone for a human to clean up, exactly as it already did
# before this function existed.
#
# Defined this early, and callable on its own, so
# `tests/upgrade-plugin-cache-sweep.test.ts` can source this file with
# MEMESH_UPGRADE_PLUGIN_SOURCE_ONLY=1 (below) and call it directly against a
# throwaway root — testing the shipped function, not a hand-copied
# reimplementation of it — without running the rest of this script, which
# talks to a real Claude Code marketplace checkout.
