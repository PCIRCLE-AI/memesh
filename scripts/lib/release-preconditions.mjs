// What must be true before a release is cut — as a pure function, and the
// release notes extractor that goes with it.
//
// `scripts/lib/published-version.mjs` catches the state this file exists to
// prevent: `main` declaring a version that no tag, and therefore no npm
// release, backs. Its error message names the way out in prose — "tag
// vX.Y.Z and `gh release create`" — and prose in an error string is a
// suggestion, not a gate. Nothing performed those steps, so the release was
// three hand-typed commands whose middle could be interrupted by a crash, a
// context switch, or an assistant deciding the session was over. v4.2.11 sat
// in that middle for five days.
//
// The window cannot be closed by documenting it better. It is closed by
// making the whole release one command that either refuses or completes:
// `npm run release:finish`.
//
// Kept as a pure function, separate from the script that runs it, for the
// same reason `published-version.mjs` is: the happy path cannot be exercised
// locally without cutting a real release, so the only way both directions get
// pinned is to hand the decision its inputs.
