/**
 * One door before a release.
 *
 * The gates this repository owns were reachable only as a list of commands
 * someone had to remember, and the release incidents show what that costs:
 * every one of them (v4.7.0's tag with no npm publish, v4.8.2's stale plugin
 * cache, the 4.8.2-CLI-beside-4.8.3-plugin skew) happened with green gates,
 * because the green ones were not the ones that would have gone red.
 *
 * So this runs the enumerable gates in one place, reports each step's REAL
 * exit code, and — the half that keeps it honest — prints what it did not
 * check and could not. A gate that quietly omits a check reads exactly like
 * one that ran it.
 *
 * It shares its middle step with `prepublishOnly`: both call `verify:artifact`
 * rather than repeating the sequence, because two copies of one list is how
 * every drift in this repository started.
