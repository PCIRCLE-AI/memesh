/**
 * What a release gate cannot see: the machine.
 *
 * Every gate in this repository runs on a fresh checkout or a fresh install,
 * and every failure that reached a user lived in state that already existed:
 * v4.7.0 had a tag and a GitHub Release and npm never got the package;
 * v4.8.2's plugin cache was keyed by version and went on serving 4.8.1 code;
 * on 2026-09-02 a PATH CLI on 4.8.2 sat beside a plugin on 4.8.3. All three
 * shipped with every gate green.
 *
 * So this one runs AFTER the release, against the published version, and asks
 * the questions those incidents answer badly:
 *
 *   registry  — is the version actually on the registry, and is it `latest`?
 *   consumer  — does a fresh install FROM THE REGISTRY run that version?
 *   artifact  — does the released artifact's own doctor find its tree intact?
 *   machine   — is that version what this machine has installed?
 *
 * It is read-only with respect to owner state: the fresh install goes to a
 * throwaway prefix, every child process gets a throwaway MEMESH_DIR and
 * MEMESH_DB_PATH so nothing opens the real knowledge graph, and remediation
 * commands are printed rather than run. The installed state of this machine
 * belongs to its owner.
