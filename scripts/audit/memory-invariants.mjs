// =============================================================================
// Memory-layer invariants — checked against a REAL knowledge graph, read-only.
// =============================================================================
//
// Why this exists. v4.8.2 was reviewed seven times before release: two whole-
// diff reviews, a security review, a replay review, a contract review, a
// loop-closure pass and a guard sweep. Then dogfooding found three defects in
// the memory layer that every one of those reviews had missed — not because a
// reviewer was careless, but because all seven reviewed the DIFF, and the
// three defects sat in code the release never touched:
//
//   #240  the Stop hook re-appended one session's summary on every Stop
//         (measured: 196 observations, 50 unique, on one entity)
//   #241  learn() fused unrelated lessons into one `-other` entity per project
//         (measured: 68 observations, ~17 lessons, on one entity)
//   #242  a memory in the `global` namespace with no project tag was injected
//         nowhere (measured: 2 such entities, one a standing behaviour rule)
//
// Each of those is a one-line SQL question against the graph. A diff review
// cannot see them at any coverage; a query against the data sees them in
// milliseconds. That is the whole method: the graph is the product, so the
// graph is what gets checked.
//
// Contract:
//   - READ-ONLY. Opened with `?mode=ro`; there is no write path in this file.
//   - Exit 1 on any violation, 0 otherwise, 2 if the database cannot be read
//     or an invariant's own post-filter throws (a bug here, not a finding).
//   - Each invariant prints the offending rows, bounded, so the report is
//     actionable without a second query.
//   - Adding an invariant here is how a memory-layer defect stays fixed. A
//     fix without an invariant can regress silently; this file is the only
//     place that watches the data itself.
//
// Usage:
//   node scripts/audit/memory-invariants.mjs                 # ~/.memesh
//   node scripts/audit/memory-invariants.mjs --db <path>     # any graph
//   MEMESH_DB_PATH=... node scripts/audit/memory-invariants.mjs
//
// It is NOT part of `verify:release`, deliberately: the release gate must be
// reproducible on a fresh clone, and a real graph is per-machine state. Run it
// as the dogfood step before declaring a release verified, and in the weekly
// audit. It IS covered by tests/audit/memory-invariants.test.ts, which seeds
// each violation into a throwaway graph and requires exit 1.

    // There is deliberately no NAME predicate, and that is the whole point of
    // this invariant's second version.
    //
    // It used to ask `WHERE e.name LIKE 'session-%-summary'`, which keyed the
    // check to the NAME the ONE hook fixed for #240 happened to write. Two
    // sibling hooks write the same way under different names, and the
    // detector was structurally blind to both: measured on the maintainer's
    // graph, 2,188 duplicate rows on 58 `pre-compact-<sessionId>` entities
    // (worst: 220 observations, 2 distinct) and 14 on `commit-<sha>`, none of
    // it visible while this line named a session summary. A check keyed to
    // where the last bug was found only ever finds that bug again.
    //
    // The two narrower scopes that suggest themselves are both the same
    // mistake one layer out, and the snapshot says so:
    //   - `source:auto-capture` tag — `commit-32e98b8` HAS duplicates and does
    //     NOT carry the tag, and only 941 of 1,463 commit entities carry it at
    //     all. The tag is a proxy for the writer, not for the question.
    //   - entity TYPE — `pre-compact-*` is type `session-summary` while the
    //     real `session-<id>-summary` rows are type `session-insight`, so a
    //     type-keyed query would drop the family this invariant was written
    //     for in the first place.
    //
    // WHY a repeat is a defect at all, and what the exception is.
    //
    // Every reader that consumes observations AS CONTENT selects `content`
    // and nothing else (`grep -rn 'FROM observations' src/ dashboard/src/` —
    // `src/db.ts`, `src/knowledge-graph.ts`, `src/core/{operations,dreamer,
    // why,conflict-judge}.ts`; the dashboard and HTTP transport read none of
    // it directly). The single place `created_at` is selected is
    // `splitFusedLessons` (src/storage/graph-repairs.ts), which MOVES rows and
    // never displays the column. So a second row with identical content is
    // invisible to every reader: it says nothing the first row does not,
    // whatever event produced it. That holds
    // for the append-log entities the wide scope now also reaches —
    // `task-state:memesh`, `weekly-summary-*`, a `coordination-request` — and
    // `task-state` keeps its actual state in metadata (see
    // src/core/task-state-store.ts: "Metadata is the state's home"), so the
    // repeated history line is doubly unreachable.
    //
    // The exception is a reader that treats the list as ORDERED BLOCKS rather
    // than a bag of sentences. There are two:
    //   - `groupLessons` (src/storage/graph-repairs.ts:243) cuts a lesson
    //     entity's observations into lessons at each `Error: ` line.
    //   - `parseStructuredBlocks` (dashboard/src/components/LessonCards.tsx)
    //     does the same cut in the dashboard, keyed on CONTENT (an `Error:`
    //     line followed by a `Fix:` or `Root cause:` line) rather than type,
    //     so it renders any entity whose observations happen to have that
    //     shape — not only `lesson_learned`.
    // In both, a repeated line is not indistinguishable — its POSITION says
    // which lesson it belongs to, and two lessons in one bucket sharing a
    // `Fix:` line is ordinary. The exclusion below is keyed to the three
    // types the rest of this repository already treats as one lesson family
    // (`grep -rn "lesson_learned', 'lesson', 'mistake'" src/ scripts/` —
    // src/core/analytics.ts, src/core/work-topology.ts, src/core/doctor.ts,
    // scripts/hooks/_shared.js), not to a single type name: `lesson_learned`
    // alone left `lesson` and `mistake` entities with the same Error/Fix
