// =============================================================================
// Generate skills-manifest.json — SHA-256 manifest of every file that
// ships to the user's machine and gets executed or loaded as a prompt.
//
// F4 (skill supply chain): the npm `--provenance` flag attests that the
// tarball was built from this repo at this commit, but it does not let
// a user verify that the *runtime* files (skill prompts + hooks) match
// what's in the repo at the published version. A compromised publish
// box could rebuild with extra payload before tarballing.
//
// This manifest closes that gap: at install/run time, `memesh doctor
// --verify-skills` recomputes hashes and compares against the manifest
// shipped inside the package. Tampering shows up as a hash mismatch.
//
// What's covered:
//   - skills/**/SKILL.md           (loaded as Claude system prompt)
//   - scripts/hooks/*.js           (run in user's Claude Code process)
//   - hooks/hooks.json             (declares which hooks are active)
//   - .claude-plugin/mcp.json, .claude-plugin/plugin.json,
//     .codex-plugin/mcp.json, .codex-plugin/plugin.json
//     (host wiring)
//
// What's NOT covered (out of scope for this manifest):
//   - dist/**/*.js — Node code path. Tampering there is detected by
//     npm provenance + the standard package signature; covering it
//     here would just duplicate work and bloat the manifest.
