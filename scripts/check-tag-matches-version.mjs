/**
 * Fail if the release tag and package.json disagree about the version.
 *
 * `publish-npm.yml`'s `publish` job fires on `release: published` and
 * publishes whatever version package.json carries, with nothing comparing it
 * to the tag the release was cut from. The same workflow's `promote` job
 * reuses this exact check on `release: released` before moving the `latest`
 * dist-tag, for the same reason. Two ways a mismatch goes wrong:
 *
 *   - Tag `v4.2.12` on a commit whose package.json says `4.3.0` publishes
 *     4.3.0 while the GitHub release advertises v4.2.12. Users install a
 *     version whose release notes describe something else.
 *   - Tag a commit whose package.json still says an already-published version
 *     and the run fails at the very last step, after ~10 minutes of build,
 *     tests and two smoke suites.
 *
 * Both are cheap to catch first. Accepts `v4.2.11` and `4.2.11`.
 *
