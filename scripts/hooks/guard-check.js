// Lesson guards — PreToolUse hook for Bash (G1).
//
// A guard is a failure-lesson a human promoted (via the dream proposal
// queue) to speak at the moment its mistake is about to repeat: a regex
// over the command about to run. This hook is the Bash evaluation point;
// the Edit/Write point lives inside pre-edit-recall, which is already
// wired to that matcher.
//
// Contract, in order of importance:
//   1. NEVER block or slow the user's work: every failure path is a
//      silent pass (with a stderr trace), and v1 guards only WARN — the
//      warning is additionalContext, exit code stays 0.
//   2. The guard message is memory content — attacker-influenced in the
//      general case — so it is fenced by buildReferenceContext exactly
//      like every other injection path.
//   3. Every fire is counted (metadata.guard.fires): a guard that never
//      fires or fires constantly is a review item, and the count is what
//      surfaces it.
