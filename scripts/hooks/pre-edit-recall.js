// Continuous Recall — PreToolUse hook for Edit/Write
// When editing a file, checks if MeMesh has relevant memories
// and injects them as context. Throttled: max 1 recall per file per session.
//
// Also the Edit/Write evaluation point for lesson guards (G1): accepted
// guards match against the path plus the content about to be written, and
// a hit injects the lesson's warning at the exact moment its mistake is
// about to repeat. Guards are NOT throttled — a dangerous edit is
// dangerous every time.
