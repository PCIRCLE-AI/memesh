// There is no in-process timeout guard, and its absence is deliberate.
//
// This file used to arm `setTimeout(() => process.exit(0), 10_000).unref()`.
// It could not fire. Everything after `stdin`'s `end` event is one
// synchronous block — no `await`, no callback — so the event loop never gets
// a turn between the handler starting and the process exiting, and a JS
// timer cannot interrupt a blocking SQLite call. The one window where it
// COULD have run is while stdin is still open, which is not where a hook
// hangs.
//
// The timeout that does work is external: `hooks/hooks.json` declares
// `"timeout": 10` for PreCompact, and the harness enforces it on the
// process. `openHookDb` additionally caps the SQLite lock wait at 2s so
// contention ends in a skipped capture rather than in that kill.

// See post-commit.js for why every exit path leaves a record (#327).
