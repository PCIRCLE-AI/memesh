// Decision Nudge — PostToolUse hook for ExitPlanMode and AskUserQuestion (#277).
//
// MeMesh's read side is automatic (SessionStart, PreToolUse Edit/Write inject
// memories), but the write side had no in-flow trigger: an agent could make
// several decisions in a session and store none of them until the user said
// "remember this". `ExitPlanMode` (a plan just got approved) and
// `AskUserQuestion` (the user just chose between options) are the two tool
// calls where a decision is most likely to have just been made, so this hook
// fires there and reminds the model — once per tool per session — to use
// `remember` if the decision is worth keeping.
//
// Contract, in order of importance:
//   1. NEVER block or slow the tool call: every failure path is a silent
//      pass (with a stderr trace for anything that looks like schema
//      drift), and this hook only ever emits additionalContext — exit code
//      stays 0 no matter what.
//   2. NEVER open the database. Unlike the capture hooks (post-commit,
//      session-summary, pre-compact), this hook writes nothing to MeMesh
//      itself — it only reminds the model to. Nothing here needs a
//      knowledge-graph handle, so nothing opens one; that keeps the hook
//      fast (well under its 5s budget) and removes an entire class of
//      failure (lock contention, migration, corrupt schema) from a hook
//      whose only job is a one-line reminder.
//   3. Rate-limited to at most once per tool per session, or a plan-heavy
//      session would see the same line after every ExitPlanMode call. A
//      per-(session, tool) flag file under MEMESH_DIR is the mechanism —
//      see claimNudge() for why, and why it is a NEW mechanism rather than
//      a revived one.
