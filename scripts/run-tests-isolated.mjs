 * Run the test suite against a throwaway HOME.
 *
 * The suite writes to `~/.memesh` — `prepublishOnly` ran it against the
 * maintainer's real home directory, re-introducing on the publish path the
 * hazard `scripts/release-verify.sh` was changed to remove in this same series.
 *
 * MEMESH_DB_PATH is deliberately NOT set: several hook tests exercise the
 * "no database yet" branches, and pointing the env var at an existing file
 * makes those branches unreachable. An isolated HOME is the right isolation;
 * a fixed DB path is not.
 *
 * One owner for "how the suite is run", so the publish path and the release
 * script cannot drift again.

  // the whole suite at the real config and the real database, from the publish
  // path. The docblock above warned about *setting* MEMESH_DB_PATH and said
  // nothing about inheriting it. Common credential variables are also stripped
  // so tests never receive owner-controlled secrets as accidental inputs.

  // that need the identical guarantee. Three copies is how two of them ended
  // up pinning only HOME.
