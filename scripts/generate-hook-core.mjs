// Hook-core generator (F5 mirror, step B)
// =======================================
//
// Claude Code hooks (`scripts/hooks/*.js`) must run the always-on capture path
// even when `dist/` is absent (plugin-marketplace `--ignore-scripts`) or stale
// (source pull before build). Historically that forced a 965-line hand-mirror
// of `src/core` inside `_shared.js`, which drifted and shipped the P0 FTS bug.
//
// `src/core/paths.ts` and `src/storage/fts-index.ts` are runtime-LEAF modules:
// paths.ts imports only node builtins; fts-index.ts has only a type-only import.
// So `tsc` already emits SELF-CONTAINED JS for them (no relative imports). This
// script copies those compiled leaf modules to `scripts/hooks/_generated/`,
// committed and shipped in the tarball. Hooks import the committed copy — it is
// version-locked to its own install (no cross-version staleness) and present
// even when the rest of `dist/` is not (it lives next to the hooks, not in dist/).
//
// The copy is deterministic (same TS + tsconfig → same JS + fixed banner), so a
// `git diff --exit-code` in CI fails when a maintainer edits the core source but
// forgets to regenerate. That, plus the behavioural parity test
// (`tests/hooks/mirror-parity.test.ts`), makes mirror drift structurally caught.
//
// Wired into `npm run build` AFTER `tsc` and BEFORE `generate-skills-manifest`
// (so the manifest hashes the fresh generated files). Also runnable standalone:
//
//   node scripts/generate-hook-core.mjs
//
