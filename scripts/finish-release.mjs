// Finish a release in one operation: tag, GitHub Release, npm publish.
//
//   node scripts/finish-release.mjs --dry-run    # what it would do, and why it would refuse
//   npm run release:finish
//
// WHY THIS IS ONE COMMAND
//
// Merging the release PR bumps `main` to a version nobody can install yet.
// `scripts/lib/published-version.mjs` makes that state loud — `verify:release`
// on main FAILS with "main declares X and no vX tag exists" — and that failure
// is the guard working, not a bug to investigate. But the guard only shouts;
// it cannot shorten the window. Closing it was three hand-typed commands, and
// v4.2.11 spent five days between the first and the last.
//
// So the remedy stops being prose in an error message and becomes this. It
// either refuses with every reason listed, or it finishes.
//
// ONE API CALL, NOT THREE COMMANDS
//
// `gh release create` creates the tag itself from `--target`. That matters
// beyond convenience: `git tag` + `git push origin <tag>` + `gh release create`
// has a failure mode that is WORSE than the one being fixed — a pushed tag
// with no release publishes nothing (publish-npm.yml fires on
// `release: published`; a bare tag push does not trigger it), while
// `verify:release` now sees the tag and reports ok. Main would look released
// and npm would not have it, with no gate left looking. One call cannot land
// half way: either the release and its tag both exist, or neither does.
//
// The tag it creates is LIGHTWEIGHT, where `git tag -a` produced an annotated
// one for some past releases (the repo has both: v4.5.0 and v4.6.1 annotated,
// v4.5.1 and v4.6.0 not). Nothing here reads the difference — no `git describe`
// exists in this repository, and `git tag --list`, `git ls-remote --tags` and
// `fetch-tags: true` treat both alike. The repository's tag ruleset does not
// object either: "Protect release and benchmark tags" covers `refs/tags/v*`
// with `deletion` and `non_fast_forward` rules only, so creating a new tag is
// not what it blocks.
//
// REAL-CREDENTIAL CHECKS, NOT JUST DOCUMENTED ONES
//
// `npm run qa:pre-release` and `npm run qa:live-journey` both existed before
// this file called either — available, but not required, which is a check
// that gets skipped exactly when a release is rushed. This file now runs
// `qa:pre-release` itself and blocks on its real exit code, and requires a
// `qa:live-journey` receipts for BOTH hosts on THIS exact commit before it
// will proceed. See the "G4" comment further down for the mechanics.

// origin's v4.1.7 tree lacks four files the local v4.1.7 tree still carries.

// public file would undo part of what the rewrite was for.) Those old refs are

// writing the new tag it was actually asked for. Measured on v4.6.2, same
// checkout: `--tags` exited 1 with 26 rejections, while
// `refs/tags/v4.6.2:refs/tags/v4.6.2` exited 0.
