/**
 * Two failure modes every command shared, and neither said what was wrong.
 *
 * A NUMERIC FLAG THAT IS NOT A NUMBER. `parseInt('abc')` is `NaN`, and `NaN`
 * was carried straight into whatever the flag fed. Each site failed
 * differently and none of them named the flag:
 *
 *   recall --limit abc   NaN into a SQL LIMIT — a raw `ERR_SQLITE_ERROR`
 *                        stack trace carrying the absolute install path
 *   export --limit abc   silently ignored; the default was used and the
 *                        user was told nothing
 *   why --line abc       NaN reached `git blame -L NaN,NaN`, the failure was
 *                        caught, and the user was told "That line does not
 *                        exist in the tracked file" — a false statement from
 *                        the one command whose contract is to abstain
 *
 * `why` had grown a hand-written guard with a comment explaining exactly
 * this. It was the only command that had. The guard is now one commander
 * coercion applied at every numeric option, so a new flag inherits it.
 *
 * A DATABASE THAT WILL NOT OPEN. Every command opens the database through one
 * helper, and that helper let the throw through: a fifteen-line Node stack
 * with the install path, from `recall`, from `remember`, from all of them.
 * `memesh doctor` handles the identical state and says what to do about it —
 * it was simply the only command that did.
 *
 * Spawns the built CLI, because both defects are about what a user SEES.
