/**
 * `memesh feedback` publishes to a PUBLIC issue tracker. Two things were wrong.
 *
 * 1. It carried the account name into it. The body is composed from `doctor`
 *    output, and doctor names paths — the database, the config file, where
 *    `memesh` resolves on PATH. On a normal install every one of those begins
 *    with the home directory, so a measured run put `%2FUsers%2F<name>` in the
 *    issue URL twice.
 * 2. Without `--no-open` the body was never shown in the terminal. It is
 *    rendered in the GitHub form, but below the fold of a page the user opened
 *    in order to type — the diagnostics block scrolls past and is submitted
 *    unread.
 *
 * The redaction test asserts the absence of a string, which is the weak
 * direction: a `feedback` that printed nothing at all would pass it. So each
 * case also asserts the positive — that the redacted path is still THERE, as
 * `~/...`. Absence plus presence is the pair; absence alone is not evidence.
