/**
 * Three PASSes doctor gave for things it had not checked.
 *
 * These run the built CLI against a real database in a throwaway HOME,
 * deliberately, because each defect was invisible to a stub:
 *
 *   C1  "Hooks wired into Claude Code / PASS" came from the presence of
 *       `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, which is inside the npm tarball and
 *       therefore present on every install. The unit fixture did not create
 *       that file, so the unit test saw the WARN branch that no real user
 *       could reach.
 *   C5  "auto-capture loop is alive" counted entity TYPES, one of which
 *       (`lesson_learned`) is what `memesh learn` writes — a command the user
 *       types. Measured on a brand-new HOME with no `.claude` directory at
 *       all: one hand-typed `learn` produced the PASS.
 *   C2  `config set llm.apiKey` with no `llm.provider` left `status` printing
 *       `LLM: undefined (undefined)` and every LLM feature a silent no-op.
 *       The doctor stub for hook-activity asserts on SQL text and never
 *       executes it, so a predicate change is exactly what it cannot see.
 *
 * Each case asserts the honest verdict AND its opposite, so a doctor that
 * simply stopped emitting the row would fail here rather than pass.
