/**
 * Two reads that quietly changed the ranking of the memories they touched.
 *
 * `access_count` and `last_accessed_at` are 20% of the score. Every recall
 * bumps them, and that is correct — a recall IS a use. These two were not
 * recalls.
 *
 *   `export`   `exportMemories` calls `kg.search`, so taking a backup bumped
 *              the counter and stamped "used just now" on up to a thousand
 *              memories. The act of copying the graph re-sorted it.
 *
 * `listByType` already drew this line by simply never calling `trackAccess`
 * ("a type browse is a catalogue read"). These paths share a query with real
 * recalls, so they say so with a flag instead.
