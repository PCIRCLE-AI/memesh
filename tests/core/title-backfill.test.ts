/**
 * The UX-1 title backfill, and the two ways it could silently do harm.
 *
 * The pass gives pre-title rows a heuristic display title. It is fill-only
 * (`WHERE title IS NULL`) and marker-guarded, borrowing both disciplines from
 * the signal-score backfill next to it — a row that already has a title must
 * come out untouched, and a row whose metadata cannot be parsed must be left
 * entirely alone.
 *
 * The part with real teeth is FTS. `insertFtsRow` folds the title into the
 * indexed text, and pre-title rows were indexed WITHOUT one — so every row
 * the pass titles must be reindexed, or the next contentless-FTS delete
 * (issued with the current title folded in) would not match what the index
 * holds and would silently corrupt it. And that reindex must skip archived
 * rows: they have no FTS entry at all (archiveEntity removed it), and a
 * contentless delete for text that was never indexed is the same corruption
 * from the other direction. Both directions are pinned here by observing the
 * index's behaviour, not the code's structure: search → found; archive-then-
 * search → gone, no ghost.
