/**
 * Five diagnostics that reported the wrong thing, and the two writes that
 * had no reader.
 *
 * The shape they share is the one this whole review kept finding: a value is
 * produced correctly and then judged by something that is asking a different
 * question, or by nothing at all.
 *
 *   version compare   `packageVersion < update.latestVersion` — a STRING
 *                     comparison, with a comment conceding a semantic one
 *                     "would be more accurate" and claiming the string form
 *                     "catches 99% of cases". It stops working at the first
 *                     two-digit component: `'4.6.9' < '4.6.10'` is false.
 *                     At 4.6.10 doctor announced "Running pre-release
 *                     version (4.6.9)" while the banner urged an upgrade.
 *
 *   citation scope    doctor read the rule file at a hardcoded `'user'`
 *                     scope while both writers resolve it from the install
 *                     marker — so on a `--scope project` install it reported
 *                     the contract missing and pointed its fix at a path
 *                     nothing would ever write.
 *
 *   guard fires       `recordGuardFires` increments `metadata.guard.fires`
 *                     on every match and `applyProposal` initialises it,
 *                     with a comment saying escalation waits on "measured
 *                     fire accuracy". No command, route or panel ever showed
 *                     it.
