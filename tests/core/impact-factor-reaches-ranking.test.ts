/**
 * The impact factor is 10% of the ranking, and it reached the scorer as a
 * constant.
 *
 * `rankEntities` reads `entity.recall_hits` / `recall_misses`
 * (`scoring.ts:89`). `getEntitiesByIds` — the hydrator behind `search`,
 * `listRecent`, and the former vector supplement, i.e. every recall path at
 * the time — did not select
 * those columns. So the scorer received `undefined` for both,
 * `impactScore(undefined ?? 0, undefined ?? 0)` returned 0.5, and every row
 * got the identical 0.05 contribution forever.
 *
 * The signal itself was alive the whole time: the Stop hook writes
 * `recall_hits` from `[mem:id]` citations, and on a real graph 83 entities
 * carried accounting spanning impactScore 0.037 to 0.750. `briefing.ts`
 * hydrates the columns and got the real values; the recall path did not — so
 * one scoring function behaved differently depending on which caller reached
 * it.
 *
 * `scoring.ts:9` records that `temporalValidity` was deleted in 2026-05 for
 * being "a constant 1.0 for every entity — a no-op factor". This was the same
 * thing, in a factor nobody had checked.
 *
 * Two things are pinned, because the column being present is not the same as
 * the ranking using it:
 *   1. the hydrator carries the counters out of the database
 *   2. two memories that differ ONLY in citation history come back in the
 *      order that history implies
