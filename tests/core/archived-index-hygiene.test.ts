// Found by querying the maintainer's real graph, not by reading a diff.
// At 2136 entities (820 active, 1316 archived):
//
//   213 archived entities were still in `entities_fts`. `MATCH 'ae83279'`
//       returned the archived `commit-ae83279`.
//
// `archiveEntity` always dropped the row. `compressWeeklyNoise`, proposal
// application and `splitFusedLessons` archived with a bare status UPDATE and
// did not — and that defect fed a second:
// re-remembered entity that still had an FTS row got a SECOND document at the
// same rowid, because `createEntityInner` skipped the contentless delete for
// anything `wasArchived` on the reasoning that archiving had already removed
// it. Only one of the four archive paths had.
