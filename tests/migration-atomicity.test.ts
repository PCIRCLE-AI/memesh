/**
 * The index migration has to be safe against the other processes that share
 * the database.
 *
 * Seven hooks, the MCP server, the HTTP server and the CLI all call
 * `openDatabase()`, so "another process is writing right now" is the normal
 * case, not an edge one. The original rebuild read its source rows BEFORE
 * `db.transaction()` opened, and better-sqlite3's default transaction is
 * BEGIN DEFERRED — no write lock existed until the first statement inside it.
 * An entity committed in that window was wiped by `delete-all` and never
 * reinserted, because the row list predated it. The version marker then
 * committed, so it never retried: the memory stayed in `entities` and was
 * unreachable by search, permanently and silently.
 *
 * These cases pin the three properties that fix it — the read happens under
 * the write lock, a failure backs off instead of re-scanning the corpus on
 * every process start, and the marker is not advanced by a failed run.
