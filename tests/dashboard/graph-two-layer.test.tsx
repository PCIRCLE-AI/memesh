// UX-4's two-layer graph, from the tab's side. What this pins:
//
//   1. The work layer is what loads first — the tab's question is "what was
//      decided and learned", not "what is stored".
//   2. When the work layer is too small to be a graph, the fallback to the
//      full graph is ANNOUNCED. A silent fallback is the same defect R2
//      removed from recall: the user asked for one thing and is shown
//      another with nothing saying so.
//   3. The layer buttons carry aria-pressed, so the current layer is
//      readable without seeing the colour.
//
// The requests are asserted by URL because that is the contract between the
// bundle and the server — a mock of `fetchWorkGraph` would pass even if the
// tab called the wrong endpoint.
