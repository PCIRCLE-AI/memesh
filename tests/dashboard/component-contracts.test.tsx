// @vitest-environment happy-dom
//
// One contract, applied to the dashboard components listed below: **on
// degenerate data, a component may render an empty state, but it may not render
// the machinery, drop half the page, or reject into nowhere.**
//
// This is deliberately not nineteen "renders without throwing" tests. Those
// cannot fail for any reason a user would notice, and this repository has spent
// three releases removing checks with that property. What it asserts instead is
// the class of bug that actually reaches a dashboard user, and it takes three
// separate detectors because the three shapes each slip past the other two:
//
//   1. **Text leak.** `undefined` / `NaN` / `[object Object]` in visible text —
//      what an unguarded `value.toFixed()`, a missing field or a stringified
//      object looks like on screen — or a raw i18n KEY rendered instead of its
//      translation. That last one is not hypothetical: the auth screen shipped
//      `auth.title` to a remote operator, because `t()` returns the key on a
//      miss and five lookups were written `t('auth.x') || 'English literal'`, a
//      fallback that can never run since a non-empty string is truthy.
//   2. **Unhandled rejection.** A component with no `.catch` whose loader
//      throws.
//   3. **Render error.** A throw during the rerender that a promise callback
//      triggered. Measured: this produces NO unhandled rejection and NO text —
//      `AnalyticsTab` handed `{healthFactors:{}, loopMetric:{}, timeline:{}}`
//      silently drops four panels and leaves only the stats row. Detectors 1
//      and 2 are both blind to it; a recording error boundary is not.
//
// Every component is exercised against four API stubs: empty-but-successful, a
// failure, half a payload, and every group present but hollow. Components that
// take props get the degenerate props below.
//
// ## Why the three canaries exist
//
// The first version of this file waited with `waitFor(() => expect(container)
// .toBeTruthy())`. `container` is truthy the instant `render()` returns, so
// that wait resolved on its first synchronous check and **every assertion ran
// before the stubbed response arrived**. Measured: reverting three of the six
// guards this suite was written to protect left all 58 tests passing, and
// `GraphTab` — a live, unmutated instance of the leak in (1) — passed 3/3 while
// rendering `Cannot read properties of undefined`.
//
// Replacing the wait fixes today's instance. It does not stop the wait from
// rotting again, and neither would a per-component list of settled predicates:
// a hand-maintained list is the thing that drifted in the first place. So the
// three canaries below assert the harness's **ability to fail** — one per
// detector. If `settle()` ever stops settling, the canaries stop being caught
// and this file goes red on itself.
