/**
 * `forget` archives the whole memory ONLY when no selector was given.
 *
 * Three independent reviewers found this on three different surfaces in one
 * pass, which is what makes it a root cause rather than three bugs:
 *
 *   core   `operations.ts` used `if (args.observation)` — truthiness, so `""`
 *          read as "no selector" and fell into the archive branch.
 *   MCP    `handlers.ts` ran `stripNullProps` BEFORE `safeParse`, so a
 *          null-valued UNKNOWN key was deleted rather than rejected by
 *          `.strict()`. `forget({name, observations: null})` — plural, the
 *          word `remember` uses — therefore arrived as `{name}` alone.
 *   CLI    `--observation ""`, which an unset shell variable produces.
 *
 * All three end in the same place: a request scoped to ONE observation
 * archives the entire memory and reports `{archived: true}`, without even
 * mentioning the observation the caller asked about. `schemas.ts` already
 * documents `.strict()` as the fix for the wrong-KEY door; these are the
 * empty-VALUE and null-VALUE doors beside it.
 *
 * The invariant under test is one sentence: an empty or unknown selector is a
 * caller error, never a licence to destroy.
