/**
 * Two pre-existing defects a review of the v4.2.11 branch surfaced. Neither was
 * introduced by that work; both were found while auditing it, and both are the
 * same shape as the rest of the release — a failure that leaves the system
 * reporting normally.
 *
 *   1. `openDatabase` published its module singleton BEFORE finishing
 *      initialisation, so a throw part-way left every later caller in the
 *      process holding a handle with no schema, no migrations and no
 *      sqlite-vec.
 *
 *   2. `search({includeArchived:true})` matched NFC-normalised terms against
 *      raw storage, so a memory stored decomposed was findable while active and
 *      unfindable the moment it was archived.
