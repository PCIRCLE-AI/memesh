/**
 * The release scripts must not touch the maintainer's real data to do their job.

 * A release check once rewrote `~/.memesh/config.json` and relied on an EXIT
 * trap to restore it. The suite now runs under a throwaway HOME instead.
 *
 * This is a shell script, so there is no unit to call. The assertions are
 * structural, and they are the ones that matter: the regression is not "the
 * output changed", it is "the script started writing to the real config again".
 * A test that ran the script for real would have to have a real config to
 * damage, which is the thing being prevented.
 *
 * Recorded as unpinned during the mutation sweep of this release, then pinned.
