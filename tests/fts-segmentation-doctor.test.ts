/**
 * Doctor's stale-keyword-index check, against a real database.
 *
 * The state it detects is reachable in normal use and silent by construction.
 * `ensureFtsSegmentation` advances a version marker and only ever moves it
 * FORWARD, so a database migrated by a segmentation-aware build and then
 * written to by an older one ends up holding whole-run tokens that no segmented
 * query can match. The old build does not know the marker exists, leaves it
 * alone, and re-upgrading short-circuits — those memories stay unreachable by
 * any partial-phrase query, permanently, with `entities` intact and every
 * health signal green. Users reach it by having an npm-global and a
 * plugin-marketplace install side by side, or by downgrading after a bad
 * release. Two comments in `db.ts` claimed doctor reported this; nothing did.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM `tests/core/doctor.test.ts`:
 *
 * The first version of these tests used that file's `makeDatabase` stub, which
 * dispatches on `sql.includes('fts_vocab')` and returns a canned row. Mutating
 * `length(term) > 2` to `length(term) > 200`, and replacing the
 * `sqlite_master` guard with `if (true)`, BOTH left all 45 tests green — a stub
 * never executes the statement, so it cannot test a predicate. The predicate is
 * the fix. These run the real query against a real FTS5 index instead.
