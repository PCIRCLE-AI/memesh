/**
 * A hook must not wait for a database lock longer than the harness will wait
 * for the hook.
 *
 * `MemeshDatabase` sets `busy_timeout = 30000`, and for the processes that
 * number was chosen for — the CLI, the MCP server, the HTTP server — it is
 * right: a long write transaction can hold the lock for seconds and a writer
 * that WAITS is the whole point. A hook is not one of those. Its
 * budget in `hooks/hooks.json` runs from 3s to 10s, so a 30s wait has one
 * possible ending: the harness kills the hook. The capture is lost either
 * way; the difference is that the user also sees a hook-timeout error, and
 * that error is what turns memesh into something to switch off.
 *
 * Two invariants, and they are checked against each other rather than against
 * a number written twice:
 *   1. every hook the manifest declares has an explicit timeout
 *   2. the SQLite lock wait is strictly smaller than the smallest of them

  // What "one busy_timeout wait" costs in wall-clock time is NOT a

  // floor (process-spawn time). This test's history, in this same file:
  //   - a flat 4000ms ceiling failed on macOS CI at 4516ms / 4378ms for
  //     scripts that pay exactly one wait — pure process-spawn noise.
  //   - "floor-subtracted, must be under 1.5x HOOK_BUSY_TIMEOUT_MS (3000ms)"

  //     file/journal state the unlocked floor run never touches), and that
