/**
 * Every `/v1/...` path an in-repo client calls must be a route the server
 * registers, and must not be one the server has retired.
 *
 * `packages/python-sdk/` shipped a `consolidate()` method that posted to
 * `POST /v1/consolidate` for a full release after that endpoint started
 * answering `410 Gone`. Nothing noticed, because nothing compared the two: no
 * CI job ran the SDK's tests, no gate read its source, and its own README had
 * already been updated to say the method was retired while the code still
 * defined it. The SDK is deleted, and this is the rule that would have caught
 * it — pointed at whatever clients live here now, so the next one cannot drift
 * the same way.
 *
 * Today that is the dashboard, which is the client every `memesh serve` user
 * actually loads.
